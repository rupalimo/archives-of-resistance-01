        <!-- <p><strong>ARCHIVES OF RESISTANCE RIO DE JANEIRO / ARCHIVOS DA RESISTENCIA RIO DE JANEIRO</strong>
        </p> -->



        <p>The first iteration of Archives of Resistance took place at Capacete in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in November 2016. The residency is situated in Gloria, a local
          neighbourhood that
          serves as one of the thirteen entrances to the Santa Teresa neighbourhood known as a tourist destination despite the precariousness and insecurities on its streets. The context of Brazil and its complex socio-economic realities added
          to
          the
          layers of conversations during this encounter between artists.</p>
        <p>
          The first edition of Archives of Resistance manifested in a three-day immersion with invited Latin American artists collaborating and sharing their practices with the general public. We hosted a shorts video screening, artist talks,
          and
          workshops.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the first night of events, we curated a video screening that including works by Archivo de Memoria Trans about Gina Vivanco, a Trans woman who was killed by the police in the 80s; Catrileo Carrion Community’s work demonstrated a
          sawdust
          mountain in Neltume, Chile; and Marton Robinson showed video works using media archives that illustrate the level of ignorance and racism in Costa Rican society. The screening was followed by another showing of Joyce Wieland’s
          experimental
          films from Canada. </p>
        <p>
          Marton Robinson, Catrileo Carrion Community, and Vagalume of Verde talked about their practice through artist talks and workshops. As a means to extend the first dialogue of Archives of Resistance Rio de Janeiro to the local
          community,
          we
          invited high school activists from Santa Teresa. We also invited leading members of Vagalume o Verde, a local group of activists and Carnaval Bloco (Carnaval’s band), to join the three-day event. Through this connection, participating
          artists joined a protest/demonstration with the Horto community who were facing the threat of eviction from their families’ bicentennial home.
