      <p>Archives of Resistance is a collaborative art project that creates an open dialogue between underrepresented communities in the Americas facing social and political struggles. In this project, we examine the deeply embedded history of
        colonization that continues to dictate today’s socio-economic realities to envision parallel histories present in various communities. </p>
      <p>
        Invited artists share their contemporary artworks using diverse forms of archives as raw material. In this process, artists envision new understandings of official and familiar archives to expand their knowledge beyond institutionalized
        documents often categorized by hegemonic political powers. This project aims to look at the ways in which artists can subvert or give new meanings to the colonial construction of history. By working with diverse archives including those found
        in institutional vaults, family albums, as well as vernacular contexts, artists reveal diverse narratives and identities within the Americas. </p>
      <p>
        Participating artists will present finished, and work in progress as their commitment to their research is long-term and constantly in motion. The strengths of the works rely on the rawness of their archives however unrefined or unpolished.
        The process of storytelling and creating representational images can be fluid and complicated. The raw nature of the artists’ original source material defies colonial notions of perfection and institutionalization. Invited artists tell the
        stories of their communities through imagery that works as a puzzle piece that provides personal narratives embedded in greater socio-political contexts.
