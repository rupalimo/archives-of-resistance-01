          <p>Archivo de la Memoria Trans / Archive of Trans Memory</p>
          <div class="medium">
            <p>Buenos Aires, Argentina</p>
            <p>The Archive of Trans Memory (AMT) protects, builds and vindicates Trans memory in Argentina. Trans women activists, María Belén Correa and Claudia Pía Baudracco envisioned how they could bring together their fellow survivors and
              subsequently their memories and images. In 2012, Pía passed away just months before the Gender Identity Law became a reality in Argentina. While in exile, María Belén founded the AMT where she met with her fellow survivors who lived in
              different parts of the world. For two years, the AMT existed as a virtual space to share anecdotes, photos, testimonies, and letters from the community. In 2014, collaborator and visual artist, Cecilia Estalles, began the archiving
              process to compile, preserve and protect the memories of the Trans community in Argentina.</p>
            <p>
              The Archive contains a collection of more than 15,000 documents. The items in the archive are from the early 20th century until the late 1990s. This is a rich collection that includes photographs, film, audio bytes, journals and
              official documents such as Identification cards, passports, letters, notes, police files, and magazine articles. The AMT's mission is to gather and rescue a collection of archives that outline the history of the Argentine trans
              community. The AMT’s policy is to document the lives of Trans women to support the fight against systemic Transfobia in society through educational training and activism for equal rights for Trans women in the workforce. In addition,
              the Archive is a cooperative space in which artists, activists, archivists, journalists, historians, curators, art critics, editors, conservators, researchers and teachers collaborate to create new projects in diverse media and
              languages.</p>
            <p>
              Currently, its working team includes María Belén Correa, Cecilia Estalles, Carmen Ibarra, Cecilia Saurí, Magalí Muñiz, Carola Figueredo, Teté Vega, Luis Juárez, Julieta Gonzalez, Sonia Beatriz Torrese, Carolina Nastri, Guade
              Bongiovanni, Marina Cisneros, Katiana Villagra, Paola Guerrero.</p>

            <p>
              We are a two-spirit Mapuche (epupillan) community that develops research-creation artistic projects that are intimately linked to specific territories and communities. We have been working since 2015 from Wallmapu/Chile and now our
              community is located both in California/Kumayaay land and South America. This hemispheric experience gives us a privileged point of view to see social change, land disputes and colonization from a broad perspective. We have worked
              from
              art
              crossing our biographies with diverse materialities and contexts with whom we get involved. We use video, archives, writing and weaving as practices that are intertwined with our own life. As a two-spirit non-reproductive community we
              use
              our vital energy to connect with others (human and non-humans) to share reflections and concerns. We use our biographies and positionalities to depict indigenous life as an ever-changing, deeply rooted and critical practice, but also
              a
              transformative and creative force. We engage in a practice of occupation and re-structuring of the surface of the video/projection. We understand these surfaces as interfaces for decolonization, territorial imagination and
              re-connection
              with each other. We believe in a future where a queer BIPOC utopia is possible, and we are rehearsing this idea in our everyday artistic and political practice.

            <p>Jennifer Dysart is an archive enthusiast with a deep love of found footage and experimental filmmaking. Her film projects interrupt the colonial power of archives and represent a growing body of work that prioritizes a return home of
              archival materials to Indigenous communities. She was an Artist-In-Residence for Archive/Counter-Archive at Library and Archives Canada (2019) and showed Revisiting Keewatin (Biophilia Edit) as a large-scale installation projected on
              the outside of the Archives of Ontario building through the Art Gallery of York University for Nuit Blanche 2022. Her films Caribou in the Archive (2019), Kewekapawetan: Return After the Flood (2014) and Moss Origins (2011) have
              screened around the world. She was born in Alberta, raised in BC, currently lives in Hamilton, Ontario and has Cree roots on her Dad's side from South Indian Lake in northern Manitoba, Canada. In 2014, Jennifer won the MFA thesis prize
              at York for her graduate work which includes Kewekapawetan: Return After the Flood.

          <p>Marton Robinson</p>
          <div class="medium">
            <p>Cost Rica &#183; Canada &#183; USA</p>
            <p>Costa Rican artist Marton Robinson has an interdisciplinary background informed by his studies in both Physical Education and Art and Visual Communication. He completed an MFA at the University of Southern
              California.
              Robinson’s art,
              which
              is informed mainly by African-American traditions, challenges the conventional representations of black identities in art history, mainstream culture, and the official national narratives, especially those of Costa Rica. With an
              often
              ironic and rhetorical take on the constructs of racism, this practice endeavors to confront the hierarchies and conceptions inherited from colonialism in order to subvert the mindsets and prejudices ingrained in our social
              experience.
              Robinson’s work exposes the nuances present in the Afro-Latino experience, enriching the critical discourse of contemporary works of the African Diaspora.</p>
            <p>
              Robinson has participated in exhibitions in spaces such as: The Getty Center, California; Museo de Arte y Diseño Contemporáneo, Costa Rica; Vincent Price Art Museum, California; Fundación Ars TEOR/éTica, Costa Rica; Museo de
              Arte

            <p>North Bay, Canada</p>
            <p>History / Background: Founded in 1974 and incorporated in 1977, the White Water Gallery (WWG) was originally created to facilitate opportunities for local artists in need of professional development who were unable to
              find
              accommodating
              venues for their research and dissemination projects. This need combined with the dedication of many local artists founded an institution devoted to the support of artistic development prioritizing research, risk-taking and
              experimentatio10
              in the arts. Today many of Canada’s most established and successful artists acknowledge the role WWG has played in advancing their careers.
