      <p>Archive of Resistance: The Northern Migration brings together a unique mix of collaborators composed of artists, designers, archivists, and educators. Together, they draw parallels between narratives of resistance across the Americas to
        celebrate those who are often forgotten or dismissed in colonized lands.</p>

        <h5>Archive of Trans Memory</h5>
        <img src="../assets/collaborators/Archives.jpeg" width="50px" title="">
        <p>Buenos Aires, Argentina</p>
        <p>The Archive of Trans Memory was created in 2013 as an initiative of Trans activist María Belén Correa along with the help of visual artist Cecilia Estalles. Together, they initiated the digital preservation, conservation and compilation of
          the archives. The archive functions to provide a space for visual and political research that gathers and rescues documents that demonstrate the heritage and history of the Argentine trans / transvestite community.</p>
        <p>
          The archive was formed to create new possibilities and a fertile territory for addressing new narratives and alternate historical discourse within this community. It creates an alternative cartography by actively looking to develop new
          links between past, present and future.</p>
        <p>
          The work team is made up of a specialized team of surviving trans women, contemporary photographers and curators of photographs and documents. It is a collaborative space in which journalists, historians, curators, art critics, editors,
          curators, researchers and teachers can explore the complexities of identities in new ways presented through diverse disciplines.</p>
        <p>
          The members of the Trans Memory Archive are: Carla Pericles, Magalí Muñiz, María Belén Correa, Car Ibarra, Cecilia Estalles, Cecilia Saurí.

        <h5>Catrileo Carrion Community</h5>
        <img src="../assets/collaborators/CCC.png" width="50px" title="">
        <p>Chile/ U.S.A.</p>
        <p>Catrileo+Carrión Community (Wallmapu/Chile – Kumeyaay Land/San Diego, CA):
          We are a two-spirit Mapuche (epupillan) community that develops research-creation artistic projects that are intimately linked to specific territories and communities. We have been working since 2015 from Wallmapu/Chile and now our
          community is located both in California/Kumayaay land and South America. This hemispheric experience gives us a privileged point of view to see social change, land disputes and colonization from a broad perspective. We have worked from art
          crossing our biographies with diverse materialities and contexts with whom we get involved. We use video, archives, writing and weaving as practices that are intertwined with our own life. As a two-spirit non-reproductive community we use
          our vital energy to connect with others (human and non-humans) to share reflections and concerns. We use our biographies and positionalities to depict indigenous life as an ever-changing, deeply rooted and critical practice, but also a
          transformative and creative force. We engage in a practice of occupation and re-structuring of the surface of the video/projection. We understand these surfaces as interfaces for decolonization, territorial imagination and re-connection
          with each other. We believe in a future where a queer BIPOC utopia is possible, and we are rehearsing this idea in our everyday artistic and political practice.

        <img src="../assets/collaborators/Marton.jpg" width="50px" title="">
        <p>Cost Rica / Canada / USA</p>
        <p>Costa Rican artist Marton Robinson has an interdisciplinary background informed by his studies in both Physical Education and Art and Visual Communication. He completed an MFA at the University of Southern California. Robinson’s art, which
          is informed mainly by African-American traditions, challenges the conventional representations of black identities in art history, mainstream culture, and the official national narratives, especially those of Costa Rica. With an often
          ironic and rhetorical take on the constructs of racism, this practice endeavors to confront the hierarchies and conceptions inherited from colonialism in order to subvert the mindsets and prejudices ingrained in our social experience.
          Robinson’s work exposes the nuances present in the Afro-Latino experience, enriching the critical discourse of contemporary works of the African Diaspora.</p>
        <p>
          Robinson has participated in exhibitions in spaces such as: The Getty Center, California; Museo de Arte y Diseño Contemporáneo, Costa Rica; Vincent Price Art Museum, California; Fundación Ars TEOR/éTica, Costa Rica; Museo de Arte
          Costarricense, Costa Rica; New Wight Gallery, California; X Bienal Centroamericana, Costa Rica; Pacific Standard Time LA/LA; Aidekman Arts Center, Boston; Le Palais de Tokyo, France; Bergen Kjøtt, Bergen, Norway; Centro de la Imagen,

        <p>MISSION: White Water Gallery is a not-for-profit Artist-Run Centre committed to supporting artistic practices that prioritize risk and innovation. Understanding the need to advance the public’s threshold for viewing contemporary art the
          gallery encourages outreach programming that promotes accessibility and shared knowledge.</p>
        <p>MANDATE: To advance the public’s appreciation of the arts by producing public art exhibitions and presentations, and by providing a forum for qualified artists to exhibit, present, or perform their artistic works through participation in
          such events.</p>
        <p>History / Background: Founded in 1974 and incorporated in 1977, the White Water Gallery (WWG) was originally created to facilitate opportunities for local artists in need of professional development who were unable to find accommodating
          venues for their research and dissemination projects. This need combined with the dedication of many local artists founded an institution devoted to the support of artistic development prioritizing research, risk-taking and experimentation
          in the arts. Today many of Canada’s most established and successful artists acknowledge the role WWG has played in advancing their careers.
