WEBFONT
END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

Effective as of July 20, 2021

This End User License Agreement (this “Agreement”) constitutes a legally binding agreement between you (the “Licensee”) and MCKL, Inc. (together with its successors and assigns, “Licensor”). This Agreement governs the license and use of the typeface font computer software program(s), together with any related documentation, updates, and permitted copies thereof, selected by Licensee and specified therein (the “Font Software”). 

Overview

The webfont License (defined below) under this Agreement is solely for use via the CSS @font-face technology. We license based on the number of unique monthly visitors to a website.  When you purchase a webfont License you are permitted to use the font within your organization for the specified domain. Should you need an app, desktop, server or other kind of license, please contact us.  Under no circumstances are you permitted to make modifications or derivative versions of this Font Software.  If you are a design firm you can use the trial version of a given font to pitch to a client, however the end client must license the font for any commercial use.  If you need to upgrade your webfont License, please contact us.  The Font Software is provided “as is”, but if you run into any problems, please let us know and we will help you out.

LICENSEE’S ACCEPTANCE AND USE OF THE FONT SOFTWARE CONSTITUTES ITS AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1.	Definitions. The following terms have the meaning specified below and throughout this Agreement: 

a)	A “webfont” is font software that has been created, optimized, translated or otherwise specially modified for use on the Internet for styling or viewing text on a website.

b)	The “domain” is the host name of a website’s home page. The domain may be comprised of one unique second-level domain name (as in “example” of http://www.example.com), multiple top-level domains (as in .com, .org, .fr, etc.), and multiple sub-domains (as in “shop” of shop.example.com, or “blog” of blog.example.com, etc.). Under this license, Licensee must own the domain and control the content of the licensed websites.

c)	A “website” is defined as a collection of related web pages organized under a single domain. The website may be viewed with a web browser and/or via a web-based mobile app provided that the webfonts are not included or embedded as explained in section 2 below. A web-based mobile app is restricted to operating on a hand-held device running one of the following operating systems: Android, iOS, Windows Phone or Windows RT.

2.	License. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a revocable, limited, non-exclusive, royalty-fee, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable right and license to install and use the Font Software solely by Licensee and its employees and contractors in connection with Licensee’s customary internal business purposes or personal purposes and in no event for distribution or resale, either on a standalone basis or incorporated into any file or work (the “License”). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee (or its employees or contractors) uses the Font Software when an individual gives commands, whether by keyboard or otherwise, through any desktop application or program that contains a font menu (e.g., Microsoft Office suite or Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, or Photoshop, etc.). Licensee may not use the Font Software in any manner other than as expressly set forth herein. Licensee does not acquire any ownership interest in or to the Font Software under this Agreement or any other rights thereto other than to use the Font Software in accordance with the License granted and subject to all terms, conditions, and restrictions, set forth in this Agreement. Licensor reserves and shall retain its entire right, title, and interest in and to the Font Software, including all copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein or relating thereto, except as expressly granted under the License. All rights not expressly granted are expressly retained by Licensor. 

3.	Permitted Use of Webfont and Webforms. The webfonts may be used for styling text on Licensee’s website via the CSS @font-face rule for the domain specified on the applicable sales receipt. Only the WOFF, SVG, and EOT webfont files provided by Licensor may be used. The use of alternate formats (such as TTF or OTF) is expressly prohibited. Licensee may not use the webfonts as a tool or resource for third parties to create customized products or documents. Further, the webfonts may not be served to unlicensed domains, even if they are hosted on a licensed domain. The use of the Font Software for web forms is permitted. However, any other editable use of the Fonts, such as in templates or for use in the creation of customizable designs or products requires the purchase of a separate license. The use of Licensor’s webfonts on a desktop, laptop, workstation computer, mobile app, e-reader, or for any uses not expressly permitted herein is prohibited. 

4.	Unique Visitors. A unique visitor is a distinct computer or mobile device connecting to Licensee’s website. The average monthly traffic of Licensee’s website, measured in unique visitors over the span of six consecutive months, must not exceed the amount shown on Licensee’s sales receipt. If the maximum number of allowed unique visitors is exceeded for three (3) consecutive months, the purchase of an additional license is required. Licensor reserves the right to inspect or monitor Licensee’s usage. The terms and price associated with this license are based upon the domain names and maximum unique visitors. If Licensee anticipate an increase in unique visitors, increase in the number of domains or an election to not renew this license Licensee should notify Licensor as early as possible. Licensee is not entitled to a refund, offset or other adjustment in the event of a reduction in the number of domains or reduction of the number of unique viewers, irrespective of the reasons.

5.	License Restrictions.  In addition to other prohibited uses described in this Agreement, Licensee shall not be permitted to do any of the following:

a)	Copying. Copy the Font Software, except as expressly permitted by the License;

b)	Modifying or Creating Derivative Works. Modify, translate, adapt, or otherwise create derivative works or improvements, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, of the Font Software, including, without limitation, by (i) converting the Font Software into another font format or into vector outlines and/or rasterized bitmaps; (ii) translating the Font Software into other platforms (e.g., UNIX); (iii) creating additional characters, accents, symbols, or typeface weights (e.g. italics, extrabold, etc.) from the Font Software or any portion of it; (iv) altering the style of the Font Software to create an altered family (e.g. change the style to allow multiple weights such as bold, italic, bold, and bold italic to all be accessed through the regular font weight); (v) extending the language coverage of the Font Software; (vi) changing the name of the Font Software;
c)	Reverse Engineering. Reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to the source code of the Font Software or any part thereof;

d)	Removing Proprietary Rights Notices. Remove, delete, alter, or obscure any trademarks or any copyright, trademark, patent, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights notices from the Font Software, including any copy thereof;

e)	Transferring/Sublicensing. Rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise make available the Font Software, or any features or functionality of the Font Software, to any third party, including, without limitation, any advertising agency, client, printers, or parent, subsidiary, or affiliated company of Licensee, for any reason, including by making the Font Software available on a network where it is capable of being accessed by more than one device at any time;

f)	Disabling Security Features. Remove, disable, circumvent, or otherwise create or implement any workaround to any copy protection, rights management, or security features in or protecting the Font Software.

6.	Third-Party Hosting Services; Web font File Protection; Back-Up Copies. The use of third party font hosting services such as TypeKit is strictly prohibited and the Font Software should be stored and served from the same devices and location as the other software and assets associated with the licensed domains. Licensee agrees to use reasonable measures to ensure the webfonts are available only for the process of styling text on Licensee’s website. Any process, technique or device such as hot-linking, re-serving or re-directing that allows access to and/or use of the Font Software by unlicensed parties is strictly prohibited. Licensee may make a reasonable number of copies of the webfonts for back-up purposes only. Copies must contain the same documentation, copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices that appear on, in or with the webfonts. 

7.	Updates. Licensor may from time to time in its sole discretion develop and provide updates to the Font Software, which may include upgrades, bug fixes, patches, other error corrections, and/or new features (collectively, “Updates”). Updates may also modify or delete in their entirety certain features and functionality. Licensor has no obligation to provide any Updates or to continue to provide or enable any particular features or functionality. Licensee shall promptly download and install all Updates. All Updates will be deemed part of the Font Software and be subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement.

8.	Disclaimer of Warranties. THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO LICENSEE “AS IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS AND DEFECTS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE FONT SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE. WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, LICENSOR PROVIDES NO WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND THAT THE FONT SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE’S REQUIREMENTS, ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULTS, BE COMPATIBLE, OR WORK WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS, OR SERVICES, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, MEET ANY PERFORMANCE OR RELIABILITY STANDARDS, OR BE ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY ERRORS OR DEFECTS CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED.

TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, LICENSEE HEREBY WAIVES THE PROTECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE § 1542 (AND ANY ANALOGOUS LAW IN ANY OTHER APPLICABLE JURISDICTION) WHICH SAYS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.”

9.	Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO LICENSEE’S USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE FOR (I) PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST PROFITS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR (II) DIRECT DAMAGES IN AMOUNTS THAT IN THE AGGREGATE EXCEED ONE HUNDERD U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE OR LICENSOR WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

10.	Indemnification. Licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor and its parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies and licensors and each of their respective officers, directors, members, managers, employees, contractors, licensors, agents, successors, and assigns from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, settlements, costs, penalties, or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) (collectively, “Losses”) arising out of or in connection with any claim brought by a third party based on any breach, or allegation, which if true, would constitute a breach, by Licensee of (i) its representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations hereunder, (ii) applicable local, state, federal, or international law or regulation, or (iii) any party’s rights, including, but not limited to, any intellectual property rights. The indemnified parties shall promptly notify Licensee in writing of any such indemnified claim (provided, however, any delay in such notice shall not relieve Licensee of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such delay prejudices the defense of such claim) and give Licensee the opportunity to defend or settle such claim at Licensee’s sole cost and expense; provided, however, Licensee shall not settle any such claim without the applicable indemnified parties’ prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned; provided, further, the indemnified parties reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any such claim. In all cases, the indemnified parties will cooperate with Licensee, at Licensee’s sole cost and expense, in defending or settling such claim.

11.	Export Regulation. The Font Software may be subject to United States export control laws, including the Export Control Reform Act and its associated regulations. Licensee shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Font Software to, or make the Font Software accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule, or regulation. Licensee shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Font Software available outside the United States.

12.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction; Disputes. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal law of the State of California without reference to its principles of conflicts of laws and any dispute or legal claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Licensee’s use of the Font Software shall be adjudicated exclusively in either the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California, and Licensee hereby irrevocably waives all jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. Licensee agree that, regardless of any applicable law to the contrary, any legal claim or cause of action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Licensee’s use of the Font Software must be filed with a court of competent jurisdiction within one (1) year after such legal claim or cause of action arose or else will be forever barred.

13.	Remedies. In the event of a breach by Licensee of the terms of the License, including, without limitation, the restrictions under the License, Licensor will suffer irreparable harm in for which monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy, and, as such, if Licensee breaches or threatens to breach any of the obligations set forth therein, Licensor will have the right, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief or specific performance or both, from a court of competent jurisdiction, in addition to all other remedies available to Licensor at law, in equity, or pursuant to this Agreement. All remedies, whether at law, in equity, or pursuant to this Agreement, will be cumulative.

14.	Assignments. Licensor may assign or otherwise transfer any or all of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any party. Licensee may not assign or transfer Licensee’s rights or obligations under this Agreement to any party without the prior written consent of Licensee, which may be exercised in Licensee’s sole and absolute discretion. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation hereof shall be null and void and constitute a material breach hereof.

15.	Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Licensor and Licensee with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral or written discussions, documents, agreements, and prior course of dealing between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

16.	Severability. If any term, provision, or condition, or any part thereof, of this Agreement shall for any reason be found or held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the remainder of such term, provision or condition nor any other term, provision or condition, and this Agreement shall survive and be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable term, provision or condition had not been contained therein.

17.	Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended only with the written consent of the parties and the observance of any provision of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in any particular instance, retroactively or prospectively) only with the written consent of the waiving party. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.
